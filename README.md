# Summative assignment README

### Overview of the project

The project imports a dataset from kaggle, cleanses it using a number of functions, uses additional functions to create some new metrics and then finally displays the data in a variety of different charts.

The project is designed in python using both a python file to store the functions and a jupyter notebook to display all the data, in addition there is a python file used for testing the functions.

### Designing the charts

Figma was used to create a prototype of the notebook, to give an idea of how the notebook would be layed out and make creating the charts easier, this initial prototype was a wireframe and  can be seen below:

Initially the data included on the charts was unknown as the data hadnt yet been analysed, but by creating an early prototype of what charts should be included it gave an early structure to the final product as well as a structure for which charts I should be aiming to make when looking at how the columns correlate to each other. After the analysis of the data was done a second protoype, also created in figma, was produced. The second version included what each chart would be showing and added some extra context to the various frames, this added detail should make the creation of the charts much easier.

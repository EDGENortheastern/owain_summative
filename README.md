### Overview of the project

The project imports a dataset from kaggle, cleanses it using a number of functions, uses additional functions to create some new metrics and then finally displays the data in a variety of different charts.

The project is designed in python using both a python file to store the functions and a jupyter notebook to display all the data, in addition there is a python file used for testing the functions.

### Designing the charts

Figma was used to create a prototype of the notebook, to give an idea of how the notebook would be layed out and make creating the charts easier. This can be seen below
